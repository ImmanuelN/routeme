Place your RouteMe logo PNG in this folder using the filename `route-logo.png`.

The app expects the file at `assets/route-logo.png` and app.json has been configured to use it for the app icon and native splash image.

Recommended sizes:
- Icon: 1024x1024 PNG (square, no alpha recommended for Play Store)
- Splash: 1242x2436 or a large PNG that can be safely scaled; `resizeMode` is set to `contain` in `app.json` so transparent backgrounds work.

If you want me to add a placeholder PNG, tell me and I will add a small placeholder image file (note: binary placeholders will increase repo size).
